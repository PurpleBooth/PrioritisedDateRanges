# Contributing

We welcome all contributions, but please follow our [code of conduct][coc]. If you wish to make a contribution please
create a pull request if your change is small, or if your change is larger then please discuss it first in the issues.

Before a PR can be considered it must follow a few basic standards:

* There must be new tests for any new functionality
* You must be following all of the [PSR standards][psr]
* [Scrutinizer][scrutinizer] must be indicating a successful build
* Commits should be rebased and squashed down into a reasonable set of commits, each of which has all the tests passing
  in it, and commit messages must follow the [git style guide][git-style]
* The branch must be up to date with master
